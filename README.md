# Advanced Programming Exercises & Project 
Python coding exercises I did for the Advanced Programming module. 
The module also required students to create a data-driven application using an existing API of their choice. The data-driven application that I created is an Auto ML Time Series Weather Forecasting application [NeuralProphet](https://neuralprophet.com/) and [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).
