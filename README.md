# Advanced Programming Exercises & Project 
Python coding exercises I did for the Advanced Programming module. 
The module also required students to create a data-driven application using an existing API of their choice. The data-driven application that I created is an Auto ML Time Series Weather Forecasting application using [MeteoStat](https://meteostat.net/en/) for historical weather data, [NeuralProphet](https://neuralprophet.com/) as the model, [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) for the frontend, and [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to validate the model's predictions.
